## Abstract

This RSKIP proposes changes to the Bridge peg-in protocol in order to register evidence on-chain when a peg-in was rejected and why it happened.

## Motivation

These changes will improve the user experience of the peg-in.

## Specification

When a peg-in can't be properly processed (i.e. R-BTC get transferred to a destination address), the registerBtcTransaction finishes with no information on the reason of this happening. Post-mortem analysis may help determine the reason, but this is a bad UX in general.

This RSKIP proposes adding new events that help the consumers understand why the peg-in "failed".

### rejected_pegin event

```
rejected_pegin(bytes32 indexed btcTxHash, int reason)
```

This event will be generated any time a peg-in won't transfer R-BTC to the destination address.

#### Data

- btcTxHash: matches the peg-in BTC transaction hash
- reason: a numeric value indicating the reason for the rejection. see [rejection reason](#reason)

##### Reason

1 → peg-in cap surpassed.
[see the RSKIP-134](#References)

2 → legacy peg-in multisig sender.
If the sender is a BTC multisig address, the recipient can't be determined, therefore the R-BTC won't be transferred.

3 → legacy peg-in undetermined sender.
If the sender is not a valid BASE58 address (i.e. BECH32), the sender can't be determined.

4 → pegin v1 invalid payload.
If the payload doesn't respect the pegin v1 protocol ([see the RSKIP-170](#References)), the recipient can't be determined.

### unrefundable peg-in event

```
unrefundable_pegin(bytes32 indexed btcTxHash, int reason)
```

#### Data

- btcTxHash: matches the peg-in BTC transaction hash
- reason: a numeric value indicating the reason for peg-in to not be refundable. see [unrefundable reason](#reason)

##### Reason

1 → legacy peg-in unidentified sencer.
If the sender is not a valid BASE58 address (i.e. BECH32), the sender can't be determined, therefore the BTC can't be refunded.

2 → pegin v1 refund address not set, unidentified sender.
If the payload doesn't include a refund address ([see the RSKIP-170](#References)), and the sender is not a valid BASE58 address, the BTC can't be refunded.
