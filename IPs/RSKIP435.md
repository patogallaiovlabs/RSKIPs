## Abstract

This RSKIP specifies the consensus changes proposed to be included in Rootstock's network upgrade named Lovell.

## Specification

- Codename: Lovell
- Activation:
	- Rootstock Mainnet block: To be defined
	- Rootstock Testnet block: To be defined

### Included RSKIPs


### Accepted RSKIPs

- [RSKIP-419](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP419.md): PowPeg Spendability Validation Protocol
- [RSKIP-427](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP427.md): Express the amount value in wei for peg-out related events
- [RSKIP-428](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP428.md): New pegout creation event including UTXO outpoint values
- [RSKIP-438](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP438.md): Limit the maximum size of initcode and apply extra gas cost for every 32-byte chunk of initcode
- [RSKIP-445](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP445.md): MCOPY instruction
- [RSKIP-446](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP446.md): Transient storage opcodes

- [RSKIP-454](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP454.md): Support bitcoin blocks with chain work up to 32 unsigned bytes
- [RSKIP-459](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP459.md): Mark rejected peg-ins as processed
- [RSKIP-460](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP460.md): Ignore non-standard outputs when searching for the witness commitment hash

### Rejected RSKIPs

## Timeline

- JUN-27-24: RSKIP created with an initial list of proposed RSKIPs
- JAN-27-25: RSKIP-455 has been excluded from the scope of Lovell and will be evaluated for a future network upgrade.
- JAN-28-25: The proposed scope is now finalized, and it's open for comments until Feb 4th, 2025
