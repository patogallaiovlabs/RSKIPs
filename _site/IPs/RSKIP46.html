<h1 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract</strong></h1>

<p>Miners earn fees for every block they mine. The value of the fees they receive in their account is calculated by REMASC pre compiled contract.</p>

<p>In RSK node current version, miners will see their account balance increased every time they mine a block but there is no easy way to understand how does fees were calculated. This can be even worse if multiple blocks are mined in a short window of time. The main problem here is that matching between block and it’s corresponding fee must be deduced from REMASC contract.</p>

<p>This document presents a solution to clearly expose the fees per block information to miners.</p>

<h1 id="specification"><strong>Specification</strong></h1>

<p>See discussion <a href="https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/issues/83">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SubmitBitcoinBlock method</strong></p>

<p>Response should return:</p>

<p>Status. can be any of the following values: imported_best, imported_not_best, exist, no_parent, invalid_block.</p>

<p>Blockhash. RSK block hash for submitted block.</p>

<p>Height. Blockchain height where the block was added. Only returned when Status result is imported_best or imported_not_best.</p>

<p><strong>Information log</strong></p>

<p>Log should be done after the balance is transferred to the miner address. Destination address and blockhash should be topics of this log while amount can be data.</p>

<p><strong>Interface for miners</strong></p>

<p>(1) MinerServerImpl.java should have a blocksForFeesInfoCollection of blockhash and inputHeight. On a call to “getFeesInfoForMinedBlocks” each element of the previously mentioned collection will trigger a search for the fees paid. That search consists of looking for the block where the fees were paid, that would be at heigth = inputHeight + maturity. Once the block is found ask for the tx receipt of the REMASC transaction and search its logs by blockhash. Add blockhash and amount to a resultCollection. Once all the elements of the blocksForFeesInfoCollection were iterated empty the collection and return resultCollection.</p>

<p>The “addBlockForFeesInfo” will add the values recceived by parameter to blocksForFeesInfoCollection.</p>

<p>(2) This new piece of software must expose two API methods. One of them is “getFeesInfoForMinedBlocks” which can use the JSON-RPC method “<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_newfilter">eth_newFilter</a>” to create the desired search filter when first called. The filter must filter using the miner coinbase/payment address. Once the filter is created, a call to the method “<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getfilterchanges">eth_getFilterChanges</a>” will bring all the matching logs. For every log, blockhash and amount must be extracted and returned as the method result.</p>

<p>The method “getBlockFeesInfo” will receive a blockhash and inputHeight. With that information plus the RSK network maturity value a new filter object must be created. This object will filter by topic = blockhash and look only at blockchain height = inputHeight + maturity. Recently mentioned object will be the input of the JSON-RPC method “<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getlogs">eht_getLogs</a>”. For every log returned, blockhash and amount must be extracted and returned as the method result.</p>

<p>(3) Expose same methods on mnr interface as detailed in (1). Implement the search by using “<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_newfilter">eth_newFilter</a>”, “<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getfilterchanges">eth_getFilterChanges</a>” and “<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getlogs">eht_getLogs</a>” as shown in (2). Be aware that from the RSK node code the java implementation for those methods can be used instead of going through JSON-RPC.</p>
