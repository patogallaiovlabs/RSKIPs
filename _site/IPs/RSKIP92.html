<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>This RSKIP proposes a new format for the Merkle Proof format which is smaller and easier to work with. A small change to the block hash calculation is also introduced to prevent malleability attacks.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>The current Merkle Proof format is a Partial Merkle Tree based on the Bitcoin implementation. This is a general-purpose structure that can be used to prove different information about the underlying Merkle Tree. RSKâ€™s implementation is subject to malleability issues that allow an attacker to forge uncles with little to no computing power.</p>

<p>In order to fix the malleability issues and reduce block size, we propose a new format that uses known properties about the underlying Merkle Tree to minimize the amount of information needed to be encoded in the proof.</p>

<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>

<h2 id="merkle-proof-format">Merkle Proof format</h2>

<p><img src="RSKIP92/partialmerkletree.png" alt="Partial Merkle Tree" /></p>

<p>Above is the representation of a Partial Merkle Tree for a Bitcoin block with 8 transactions. Since the coinbase transaction is always the first transaction in a Bitcoin block, we know that the Partial Merkle Tree for a Merged Mining proof will always have this structure.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of this and define the following proof function:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>reduce(combinationFunction, hashesForProof, coinbaseHash)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">combinatorFunction(left, right)</code> is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sha256Hash.wrapReversed(
    Sha256Hash.hashTwice(
        left.getReversedBytes(), 0, 32,
        right.getReversedBytes(), 0, 32
    )
);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">hashesForProof</code> are the hashes in green (the Partial Merkle Tree intermediate hashes except for the coinbase hash).</p>

<p>Since Merkle Root hash is present in the RSK block header and the Coinbase hash can be derived, a minimal format for the merkle proof is derived from the proof function:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[hashForProof1, hashForProof2, ..., hashForProofN]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where the hashes for proof are ordered bottom to top. We choose to serialize these hashes as a simple concatenation of the byte representation of the hashes. The following properties derive from this format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The merkle proof will have a length in bytes that is a multiple of 32 (the hash length)</li>
  <li>The empty value is valid, and it provides a proof for Bitcoin blocks with a single transaction (the Coinbase). Note that the Coinbase hash and the Merkle Root hash are the same in this case.</li>
  <li>The number of hashes is always <code class="highlighter-rouge">tree height - 1</code>, which grows logarithmically with the number of transactions in the block</li>
  <li>Every bit in the merkle proof is part of a hash and every hash is used to compute the merkle root, thus changing a single bit always invalidates the merkle proof</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-hash-calculation">Block hash calculation</h2>

<p>We use this opportunity to propose a new RSK block hash calculation. We propose that in the encoding phase of the hash calculation we leave out both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoinMergedMiningMerkleProof</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoinMergedMiningCoinbaseTransaction</code> fields.</p>

<p>This change will prevent an array of malleability attacks such as the one that motivates this Improvement Proposal.</p>

<p>Attacks are prevented <em>by design</em> with this new hash calculation because the (possibly) malleable headers are not included in the calculation anymore. Even if a header was malleable, this error would not allow an attacker to generate uncles blocks.</p>
