<h1 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract</strong></h1>

<p>Currently a user can send funds to any 160-bit address. If the address does not exists, it is created as an account. Accounts are created by inserting a node into a state trie. Because the state trie does not re-balance itself, to prevent degeneration of the trie, addresses are hashed before being inserted in the state trie. This forces that for every transaction, the destination address is hashed before a lookup takes place. This consumes CPU resources on each transaction. This RSKIP proposes another method to protect trie degeneration: whenever a new account is created, a pre-image of the address hash must be given. Addresses are built as double-hashes to allow pre-images to be shown. Therefore the cost of hashing is shifted to the moment a new address is created, instead of being necessary for every transaction. Also this method protects from users making typos in addresses.</p>

<h1 id="motivation"><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>

<p>Increased scalability. Also prevents users from sending SBTC to incorrect addresses because the address must exists, and typos in the address wonâ€™t end up in an existing address.</p>

<h1 id="specification"><strong>Specification</strong></h1>

<p>Procedure to create a Double-Hashed address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create a keypair (Kpriv, Kpub).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let <strong>Ht</strong> = H(Kpub),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let <strong>Ha</strong> = H(Ht).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Transactions to pre-existent addresses specify <strong>Ha</strong>, while transactions that create new addresses must specify <strong>Ht</strong>. If a transaction specifies both Ha and Ht, then is can act in the two scenarios: if the destination account exists, Ha is used, if not, it is created and Ht is used.</p>

<p>If a contract calls an inexistent contract or sends SBTC to an inexistent contract whose address is a Ha, then the CALL fais and the destination address is not created.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>Therefore to find a prefix collision an attacker needs to test many addresses until it finds one.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-in-the-vm">Implementation in the VM</h2>

<p>Many opcodes in the VM use addresses. The following do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ADDRESS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BALANCE</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ORIGIN</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CALLER</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EXTCODECOPY</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>COINBASE</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CALL</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CALLCODE</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CREATE</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DELEGATECALL</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To enable double-hashed addresses, addresses must be extended by a single byte (the address type). Therefore addresses can be longer than 20 bytes. A 20-byte Double-hashed address will require 21 bytes. Solidity compiler will probably not correctly handle these types of addresses. Also the address extension means that if a 32-byte address is extended with another byte, it will overflow the EVM register size (32-bytes). We therefore should reduce the maximum address size to 31 bytes. This has the drawback that reduced has digests may not be acceptable under certain financial regulations.</p>

<p>To allow Ethereum contracts compiled with an old Solidity compile to handle correctly 20-byte addresses, when the smart contract is running in an environment version 0 (compatible with Ethereum), we truncate the msg.sender and msg.origin to 20 bytes. The same for the opcodes listed above: we only accept and process 20-byte addresses.</p>

<p>In environment version 1, we do not truncate.</p>

<p>To allow 20-byte addresses to work for 32-byte addresses, we must trim 32-byte addresses. To allow this trimming to work, we revert the order of bits in the word-state trie structure. Therefore we can, given a 20-byte prefix, extend it to the closest 32-byte address that matches that prefix. This means that the address type is not part of the 20-byte prefix, which means that version 0 contracts cannot sends funds to nonexistent addresses of a new type. They can, however, send funds or call pre-existent contracts with addresses of any type.</p>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h2>

<p>This system requires a new address format specifying Ht, and let wallets decide which to use. If wallets do not know which address to use, they can include both.</p>

<p>This new type of addresses is defined partially in <a href="https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP16.md">RSKIP16</a>  (Combined State Tree) and <a href="https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP19.md">RSKIP19</a>  (RSK Address formats).</p>
